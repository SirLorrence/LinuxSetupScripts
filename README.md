# Linux Setup Scripts

I've created these shell scripts to somewhat automate the intall process of the apps i use. This can be good for setting up an new linux system and such.
All files can be run by ```sudo bash (name of sh file or full path)```

My OS: Pop OS

All of these are made for ubuntu/debian based distros.
If you have any suggests or requests, please create an issue. Thanks
